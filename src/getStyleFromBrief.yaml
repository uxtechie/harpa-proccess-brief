        Now, revisiting the web title and design premises, make 3 proposals from the options above
        about the styles that you think are most appropriate. Please explain each choice.


        Keep in mind the following guidelines:

        - Each suggestion should include two styles.

        - Use this example as a reference:
          1. 🌟 **Modern and Clean Style:** The company description indicates a desire to convey
            importance, while at the same time being modern. A modern and clean style can achieve
            this by providing a visually appealing and easy to navigate design, thus enhancing the
            user experience.
          2. 💎 **High-End and Luxury Style:** The company offers luxury offices, suggesting a
            preference for a sophisticated ambiance. A high-end and luxury style can convey this
            feeling and appeal to their target audience: people with limited budget who still seek
            quality.
