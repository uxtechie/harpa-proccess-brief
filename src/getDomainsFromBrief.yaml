        Alright, in line with your current role, suggest {{domains.length}} different domain names.


        Premises:

        - The domain name should include all words from the company name preferably in the order
          they appear.

        - Use the design premises as a guide for suggesting domains.

        - The words you append to the company name to formulate the domain should be in
          the {{domain.lang}} language.

        - You may be creative, for example, write half of the domains using abbreviated forms of the
          words.

        - The top-level domain should be selected from this list {{domains.top}}.


        Please only provide the list of suggested domains without any additional explanation.


        Respond in {{domain.lang}}.
