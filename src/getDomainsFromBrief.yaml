          - Domain name creation guidelines:
            * The domain name should include all words from the company name preferably in the order
              they appear. The proposed domain name should be as close as possible to the company
              name.
            * The words you append to the company name to formulate the domain should be in
              the {{domain.lang}} language.
            * The top-level domain should be selected from this list {{domains.top}}.
            * A domain name should represent the essence of a business or brand.
            * A domain name should be easy to remember and spell.
            * Incorporating keywords in a domain name can improve SEO.
            * No include emojis.
            * The last 40% domains should be formatted following one or two of the following
              secondary guidelines:
              1. A domain name could include a creatively misspelled common word.
              2. An acronym can be included in a domain name.
              3. Wordplay can be used creatively in a domain name.
              4. A pun can be creatively used in a domain name.
              5. An abbreviation can be included in a domain name.
              6. A catchy phrase can make a domain name more memorable.
