            1. ðŸ“ƒ Landing Page: the page layout is in an 'F' pattern, a common web design layout
              that caters to the natural eye scanning habit of readers from left to right, and top
              to bottom.

              - Overview section: Communicates the key features and benefits of luxury apartments at
                Hive Residences.

                Employs an F-pattern layout and serves as the introduction to your site. This
                section features:

                * A full-width captivating banner image at the top, showcasing the high-end and
                  urban vibe of the apartment complex. This image immediately attracts the viewer's
                  attention and communicates the type of apartments your website offers.

                * A brief, centrally-placed introductory paragraph under the banner. This content is
                  written in bold, large fonts to draw the viewer's attention, summarizing Hive
                  Residences and its commitment to providing luxury living spaces.

              - Featured Apartments Section: Highlights a selection of available apartments, with
                images and essential details.

                Utilizes a card-based layout following an F-pattern design. Each card represents a
                distinct apartment and consists of two primary elements:

                  * A high-quality photo of the apartment emphasizing their unique features and
                    designs, occupying the upper two-thirds of the card.

                  * Essential details about the apartment such as name, location, short description,
                    price and highlights in the lower third of the card.
                
                The cards are arranged in a grid, each being clickable and leading to a more
                detailed page about the respective apartment. For a large number of apartments, a
                horizontal carousel layout can be used. This section is headed by a large "Featured
                Apartments" title and concludes with a 'View All' button for accessing all available
                listings.
