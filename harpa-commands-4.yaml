        Please, review the content of the website to summarize the design brief text right section.

        Please, disregard the "Type" and "Industry" fields that are not defined in the content of
        the design brief.


        Keep in mind the following guidelines:


        - Keep each section of the brief separate.

        - Each section should include the section title and a list of key points described in it.

        - Please add an emoji that matches to the specific content of each item as a bullet point
        for every item in the lists, as well as for each entry within the sub-lists. Try to maintain
        the same emoji for the same concepts and use different emojis for those that are different.

        - Highlight any color related to the design in *italic*.

        - Remove the "DESIGN BRIEF" title from the response.
