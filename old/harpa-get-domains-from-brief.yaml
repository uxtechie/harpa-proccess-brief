      Alright, in line with your current role suggest {{domains.length}} different domain names.


      Analyze the website content to comprehend the design brief.


      The domain name should include all words from the company's name as stated in the design
      brief, preferably in the order they appear.


      Use the design brief as a guide for suggesting domains. The words you add to the company name
      to create the domain must be in the {{domains.lang}} language. You may be creative, for
      example, write half of the domains using abbreviated forms of the words.


      The top-level domain should be selected from this list {{domains.top}}.


      Please present only the list of suggested domains without any further explanation.
